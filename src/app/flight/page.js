      <p>Along with the average Indianâ€™s ambition, air travel has also soared to new heights in recent times. Local airlines have taken to the skies, while airline prices have decreased, making air travel attractive to people. There was more than 20% increase in air travel passengers in 2016.This can be explained by a boom in cheap airline flights, accommodative airline schedules, attractive airline ticket deals, and ease in the booking system. Passengers now also find it easy to compare airline tickets online, assuring them of the best possible deals. Low-cost airlines have played a huge part in the rise in number of Indian flyers.</p>
       <h4>Rise in Business Class Travel</h4>
       <p>No wonder, India is the fastest growing airlines market in the world. A testament to this is the rise in airline reservation in business class seats on international travel, as corporates expand their interests globally. From January to August in 2016, bookings in this segment rose by around 75%. Not just business purposes, the younger generation prefers flying in the premium cabin for leisure trips too.</p>
